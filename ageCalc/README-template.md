# Frontend Mentor - Age calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Age calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://mohameda122ouz.github.io/coursera-work/ageCalc/). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanila JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how can I add my own font-family to project and how to call it in css.


```css
@font-face {
      font-family: MyOwnFontFamily;
      src: url("assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf");
    }
```

### Continued development

I will continue to learn and try to make my next new websites using react instead of only vanilla JS  


### Useful resources

- [W3Shools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.php?filename=trycss3_caret-color) - This helped me for change cursor color inside input field. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
